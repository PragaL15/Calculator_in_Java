It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Users can input the operation they want to perform and two numbers to execute the selected operation.

## Usage

1. Make sure if you have JDK or JVM 
2. Compile the `Calculator.java` file using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled Java program.

## Operations

1. Enter two numbers 
2. Select the operation (+/-/*/% and /). 
3. View the Result
4. The result of the operation will be displayed.

## Error Handling

 Handles division by zero. Error Handling The program validates user inputs to ensure they are valid numbers and a valid operation.
 Division by zero is handled, and an error message is displayed in case of an attempt to divide by zero. 
 File Structure Calculator.java: Main Java file containing the calculator implementation. 
 README.md: Documentation file providing information about the calculator and how to use it. 
 Requirements Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later. 

## Example

 Java Calculator Addition -- '+' Subtraction -- '-' Multiplication -- '*' Division -- '/' Modulus -- '%'

 Enter the Operation (+/-/*/% and /):

 Enter the first number: 5 
 Enter the second number: 3
